# setup-stake-pool

Help scripts to build a Cardano Stake Pool.

> This script is under development to use at your own risk.  
> We always recommend trying it first on the testnet

#### - Install nodes

In your block producer and relay nodes you should run the installer
`./instal-node.sh`

 This install script was tested on Ubuntu 20.04.  
 There may be differences in the initial configuration of your Ubuntu distribution, depending on your server provider.

#### - Prepare relay

`./nodes/relay/relay-topology.sh`

Select the menu option "Topology Update".  
This will create a registry in crontab, every hour the information for the registry of your topology will be sent. Look at log in ${CNODE_HOME}/logs  
You must wait 4 hours before you can continue to the next menu option. "Relay topology pull"  

#### - Register pool stake

A table is shown with the operations that you must perform in your block producer node and your air-gapped offline machine
